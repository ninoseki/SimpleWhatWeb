  @description = "Extract email addresses. Find valid email address and syntactically invalid email addresses from mailto: link tags. We match syntactically invalid links containing mailto: to catch anti-spam email addresses, eg. bob at gmail.com. This uses the simplified email regular expression from http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html for valid email address matching."

  # More Info:
  # The regex will only detect anti-spam e-mail addresses if present in "mailto:"
  # The regex does not validate e-mail addresses in "mailto:"
  #
  # Example:
  # <a href="mailto:bob at gmail dot com"> will return "bob at gmail dot com"
  # <p>Contact me:  bob at gmail dot com</p> will not be detected
  # <p>Contact me:  bob@gmail.com</p> will return "bob@gmail.com"

  # Google results as at 2011-03-19 #
  # 902 for "contact me" ("@hotmail.com"|"@gmail.com"|"@yahoo.com")

  # Matches #
  @matches = [

    # Detect valid email address in the page
    { string: /[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}/i },

    # Detect any email address in a mailto: tag
    { string: /<[^>]+href=[^>]*mailto:([^\'\"\?>]+)[^>]*>/i },

  ]

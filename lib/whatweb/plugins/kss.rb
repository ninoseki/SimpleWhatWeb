  @description = "KSS (Kinetic Style Sheets) is an Ajax framework that allows UI development without writing any Javascript. It uses style sheets with CSS-compliant syntax to declare and bind dynamic behaviors in the browser. The engine supports a set of generic DOM-like commands; they are computed on the server and sent back to manipulate the HTML page."
  @website = "http://kssproject.org/"

  # More Info #

  # The client-side Javascript library needs to be included in your page. It fetches Kinetic style sheets from the server, parses them and binds a set of action to browser events and/or page elements.

  # Server-side code is currently available for Zope (2 and 3, which includes Plone). The kss.base egg (which is currently in alpha) brings server-side support to other pythonic platforms, such as pylons, django and grok. The Javascript client-side code can be used independently of existing server-side support.

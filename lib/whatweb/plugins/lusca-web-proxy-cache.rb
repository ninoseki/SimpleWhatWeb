  @description = "Lusca Web/Proxy Cache - Lusca is a fork of the Squid-2 development tree. The Lusca project aims to fix the shortcomings in the Squid-2 codebase whilst maintaining the the Squid-2 functionality and stability. Like its predecessor, Lusca supports the majority of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 protocol and caching constructs including ETag/Variant entities. Among other things, it supports HTTP content load balancing, fail over, intelligent request/reply routing, high performance memory and disk caching, an overly-flexible access control system, support for both high performance forward and reverse proxy modes. It supports a variety of clustering protocols, including ICPv2, ICPv3, CARP and HTCP for both clustering and control. Lusca supports Cisco WCCPv2 interception in both software and hardware forwarding modes"

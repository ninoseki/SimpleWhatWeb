  @description = "gSOAP Toolkit for SOAP Web Services and XML-Based Applications. The gSOAP toolkit is an open source C and C++ software development toolkit for SOAP/XML Web services and generic (non-SOAP) C/C++ XML data bindings. The toolkit analyzes WSDLs and XML schemas (separately or as a combined set) and maps the XML schema types and the SOAP messaging protocols to easy-to-use and efficient C and C++ code."

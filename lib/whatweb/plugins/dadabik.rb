  @description = "DaDaBIK is an Open Source PHP application which allows you to easily create a highly customizable database front-end/application without coding. You can use it to create in a few minutes a very basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) database front-end or to develop a more sophisticated database application. DaDaBIK uses the ADOdb and the PDO database abstraction libraries in order to support as many DBMSs as possible, at the moment it has been tested on MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle and MS SQL Server."

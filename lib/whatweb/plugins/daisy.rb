  @description = "Daisy is a content management system that offers rich out-of-the-box functionality combined with solid foundations for extensibility and integration. Daisy consists of two main components: a stand-alone repository server accessible through HTTP/XML (using the ReST style of WebServices) and/or a high-level (remote) Java API, and an extensive editing and publishing front-end web application running inside Apache Cocoon."

# An aggressive plugin could check for the existance of a /demo folder.
# The demos still exist on many phpFreeChat isntallations, for example:
#  www.radioambientalfm.com/chat/demo/
#  www.tvacapulco.com/chat/phpfreechat/demo/
#  files.ttr.net.au/demo/
#  www.sahl-tec.com/demo/
# This plugin will also detect these demos as instances of phpFreeChat

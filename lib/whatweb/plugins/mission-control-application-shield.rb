  @description = "Mission Control Application Shield functions as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and offers the following features: SSL offloading, single sign-on, high availability through system redundancy, backend server failover and load balancing, session fixation, cookie encryption, different methods of authentication (Radius, NTLM/Kerberos, LDAP), header and form validation and a live log viewer"
  @website = "http://www.open.ch/1_1_2_1.html"

  # Since when was session fixation a feature? Perhaps they meant single sign-on.
  # Wait, what? It offers single sign-on AND session fixation? Go figure.

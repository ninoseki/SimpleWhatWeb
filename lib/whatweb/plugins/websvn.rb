  @description = "WebSVN offers a view onto your subversion repositories that's been designed to reflect the Subversion methodology. You can view the log of any file or directory and see a list of all the files changed, added or deleted in any given revision. You can also view compare two versions of a file so as to see exactly what was changed in a particular revision. Since it's written using PHP, WebSVN is very portable and easy to install."

  @description = "SitePlayer is an embedded ethernet HTTP server designed to easily and inexpensively web enable any microprocessor-based device. SitePlayer Telnet is an RS232 to Ethernet protocol converter. It allows you to connect legacy RS232 devices to The Internet by providing a TCP/IP telnet session to an RS232 port. There are many devices which can only be controlled via RS232. With SitePlayer you can now control these devices through The Internet."

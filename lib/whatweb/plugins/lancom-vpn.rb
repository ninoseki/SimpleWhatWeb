  @description = "Administration of dynamic IP addresses by LANCOM Dynamic VPN devices. Revolutionary in the LANCOM Dynamic VPN technology is that fixed IP addresses are no longer needed: The IP addresses of the respective IPSec gateways are exchanged over ISDN before the connection is established. Internet-based VPN connections thereby escape the restriction of fixed and thus expensive IP addresses."

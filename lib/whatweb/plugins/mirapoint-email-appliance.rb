  @description = "Mirapoint Email Appliance is a Unix-like standards-compliant black-box e-mail server, with built-in anti-spam, anti-virus, webmail, POP, IMAP, calendar, and LDAP routing options available. System configuration and maintenance is done through a web interface, or through SSH or telnet access to a command line interpreter (CLI). Full access to the Unix-like Messaging Operating System (MOS) is not available. Depending on the model and configuration the appliances can be used as email routers, user mail servers, or as an all-in-one server."

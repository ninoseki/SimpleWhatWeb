        \   <h2>What?</h2>\n    <p>This website is for when you try to open Facebook,
        Google, Amazon, etc\n    on a wifi network, and nothing happens. Type \"http://neverssl.com\"\n
        \   into your browser's url bar, and you'll be able to log on.</p>\n\n    <h2>How?</h2>\n
        \   <p>neverssl.com will never use SSL (also known as TLS). No\n    encryption,
        no strong authentication, no <a\n    href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security\">HSTS</a>,\n
        \   no HTTP/2.0, just plain old unencrypted HTTP and forever stuck in the
        dark\n    ages of internet security.</p> \n\n    <h2>Why?</h2>\n    <p>Normally,
        that's a bad idea. You should always use SSL and secure\n    encryption when
        possible. In fact, it's such a bad idea that most websites\n    are now using
        https by default.</p>\n    \n    <p>And that's great, but it also means that
        if you're relying on\n    poorly-behaved wifi networks, it can be hard to
        get online.  Secure\n    browsers and websites using https make it impossible
        for those wifi\n    networks to send you to a login or payment page. Basically,
        those networks\n    can't tap into your connection just like attackers can't.
        Modern browsers\n    are so good that they can remember when a website supports
        encryption and\n    even if you type in the website name, they'll use https.</p>
        \n\n    <p>And if the network never redirects you to this page, well as you
        can\n    see, you're not missing much.</p>\n\n    </div>\n    </div>\n    \n

        we collect and how we use it</h3>\n    <p>We offer a number of services that
        do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information
        to us, such as Acme Search. In order to provide our full range of services,
        we may collect the following types of information:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Information
        you provide</strong>: When you sign up for a Acme Account or other Acme service
        or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information
        (such as your name, email address and an account password). For certain services,
        such as our advertising programs, we also request credit card or other payment
        account information which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.
        We may combine the information you submit under your account with information
        from other Acme services or third parties in order to provide you with a better
        experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services,
        we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information.\n
        \     <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: When you visit Acme, we send one or more
        cookies a small file containing a string of characters to your computer or
        other device that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve
        the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, improving
        search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends, such as how people
        search. Acme also uses cookies in its advertising services to help advertisers
        and publishers serve and manage ads across the web. We may set one or more
        cookies in your browser when you visit a website, including Acme sites that
        use our advertising cookies, and view or click on an ad supported by Acme's
        advertising services.\n      <li><strong>Log information</strong>: When you
        access Acme services, our servers automatically record information that your
        browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include
        information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type,
        browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies
        that may uniquely identify your browser.\n      <li><strong>User communications</strong>:
        When you send email or other communications to Acme, we may retain those communications
        in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our
        services.\n      <li><strong>Affiliated Acme Services on other sites</strong>:
        We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal information
        that you provide to those sites may be sent to Acme in order to deliver the
        service. We process such information under this Privacy Policy. The affiliated
        sites through which our services are offered may have different privacy practices
        and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.\n      <li><strong>Gadgets</strong>:
        Acme may make available third party applications through its services. The
        information collected by Acme when you enable a gadget or other application
        is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the application
        or gadget provider is governed by their privacy policies.\n      <li><strong>Location
        data</strong>: Acme offers location-enabled services, such as Acme Maps for
        mobile. If you use those services, Acme may receive information about your
        actual location (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information
        that can be used to approximate a location (such as a cell ID).\n      <li><strong>Links</strong>:
        Acme may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether
        these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality
        of our search technology, customized content and advertising. Read more information
        about links and redirected URLs.\n      <li><strong>Other sites</strong>:

        products or services, or links from within our various services. These other
        sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
        data or solicit personal information from you.\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>Acme only
        processes personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy
        Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In
        addition to the above, such purposes include:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Providing

        network;\n      <li>Protecting the rights or property of Acme or our users;
        and\n      <li>Developing new services.\n    </ul>\n    <p>You can find more
        information about how we process personal information by referring to the
        supplementary privacy notices for particular services.\n    <p>Acme processes
        personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in
        other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server
        outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our
        own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf
        of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising
        partners.\n    <h3 id=\"infochoices\">Choices for personal information</h3>\n
        \   <p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration,
        we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in
        a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will
        ask for your consent prior to such use.\n    <p>If we propose to use personal
        information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy
        and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer you an effective
        way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes.
        We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those
        described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy
        notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.\n    <p>Most browsers
        are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to
        refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
        Acme features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.\n
        \   <p>Acme uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie on AdSense partner sites
        and certain Acme services to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage
        ads across the web. You can view, edit, and manage your ads preferences associated
        with this cookie by accessing the Ads Preferences Manager. In addition, you
        may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using DoubleClick's
        opt-out cookie.\n    <p>You can decline to submit personal information to
        any of our services, in which case Acme may not be able to provide those services
        to you.\n    <h3 id=\"infosharing\">Information sharing</h3>\n\n    <p>Acme
        only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside
        of Acme in the following limited circumstances:\n    <ul>\n      <li>We have
        your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal
        information.\n      <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
        companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing
        personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to
        process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with
        this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security
        measures.\n      <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation
        or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any
        applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,
        (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential

        safety of Acme, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.\n
        \   </ul>\n    <p>If Acme becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any
        form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality
        of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice
        before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different
        privacy policy.\n    <p>We may share with third parties certain pieces of
        aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users who searched
        for a particular term, for example, or how many users clicked on a particular
        advertisement. Such information does not identify you individually.\n    <p>Please
        contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management
        or use of personal data.\n    <h3 id=\"infosecurity\">Information security</h3>\n
        \   <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized
        access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These
        include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices
        and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
        unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.\n    <p>We restrict
        access to personal information to Acme employees, contractors and agents who
        need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our
        services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may
        be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution,
        if they fail to meet these obligations.\n    <h3 id=\"dataintegrity\">Data
        integrity</h3>\n\n    <p>Acme processes personal information only for the
        purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy
        or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection,
        storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and
        process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services
        or as otherwise permitted under this Policy. We take reasonable steps to ensure
        that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current,
        but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information
        whenever necessary.\n    <h3 id=\"access\">Accessing and updating personal
        information</h3>\n    <p>When you use Acme services, we make good faith efforts
        to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct
        this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it
        is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business
        purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information
        requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests,
        and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or
        systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy
        of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
        information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
        required. In any case where we provide information access and correction,
        we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a
        disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to
        access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details
        for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.\n
        \   <h3 id=\"enforcement\">Enforcement</h3>\n    <p>Acme regularly reviews
        its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions
        or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or Acme's treatment of personal
        information by contacting us through this web site or by writing to us at\n

        complaints at this address, it is Acme's policy to contact the complaining
        user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate
        regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve
        any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved
        between Acme and an individual.\n    <h3 id=\"policychanges\">Changes to this
        Privacy Policy</h3>\n    <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change
        from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy
        without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor.
        Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the
        changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including,
        for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). Each
        version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by
        its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy
        in an archive for your review.\n    <p>If you have any additional questions
        or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any
        time through this web site or at\n    <address>Privacy Matters<br>c/o Acme
